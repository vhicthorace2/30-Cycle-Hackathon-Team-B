## Active / Recent Tasks

## Task: Redirect YouTube OAuth callback to frontend

- Date: 2026-05-22
- Request: Update the YouTube OAuth callback to behave like OAuth login callbacks by redirecting to the frontend instead of returning JSON.
- Plan:
  - [x] Inspect the YouTube OAuth callback flow and existing redirect helper.
  - [x] Update the callback to run sync then redirect (or return no content if no redirect URL).
  - [x] Update the callback to handle failures by redirecting with an error parameter.
  - [x] Update API docs and record verification status.
- Progress:
  - Confirmed the YouTube OAuth callback returned JSON and did not use the frontend redirect helper.
  - Added redirect behavior to the callback after sync, with a no-content fallback when no redirect is configured.
  - Added error catching so that failures during sync also redirect to the frontend with an `error` query parameter instead of showing a JSON error.
  - Updated API docs to reflect the redirect behavior.
- Verification:
  - Tests: not run (not requested)
  - Logs / errors: not run (not requested)
- Result:
  - Completed. The YouTube OAuth callback now redirects to the configured frontend OAuth redirect URL after sync (and appends an `error` query parameter on failure) instead of returning JSON.

## Task: Relax Google login role mismatch and add YouTube disconnect

- Date: 2026-05-21
- Request: For Google OAuth login, stop rejecting users when the selected role differs from the role already tied to their account; instead log them in with the stored account role. Add a YouTube disconnect endpoint, then sync the frontend integrations and SME campaigns screens to the backend endpoints.
- Plan:
  - [x] Inspect auth/socials login flow, YouTube connect flow, and current frontend integrations/campaign usage.
  - [x] Update backend Google login behavior, add YouTube disconnect, and ensure platform status only reflects the `youtube-connect` grant.
  - [x] Sync frontend hooks/settings/SME dashboard campaign flow to the updated backend endpoints.
  - [x] Run targeted verification and update docs/task memory.
- Progress:
  - Confirmed the current role mismatch failure came from `AuthService.loginWithGoogle`, not from OAuth state parsing.
  - Removed the explicit `role-mismatch` rejection for existing Google-linked users, so login now reuses the stored account role automatically.
  - Added `POST /auth/socials/google/youtube/disconnect` and wired it to delete only the `youtube-connect` OAuth account grant.
  - Tightened `/users/me` and `/users/:id/platform-status` resolution so YouTube connected state is sourced from the `youtube-connect` grant instead of any Google login row.
  - Added frontend hooks for YouTube disconnect and SME campaigns, replaced the static campaign screen with live campaign create/list behavior, and wired settings to call the new disconnect endpoint.
- Verification:
  - Tests: `cmd /c pnpm exec jest --runInBand --runTestsByPath src/modules/auth/services/auth.service.spec.ts src/modules/auth/services/auth-google-oauth.service.spec.ts src/modules/users/services/users.service.spec.ts src/modules/sme-campaigns/services/sme-campaigns.service.spec.ts` (pass)
  - Logs / errors: `cmd /c pnpm run typecheck` in `backend/` (pass)
  - Logs / errors: `cmd /c pnpm run typecheck` in `frontend/` (pass)
  - Logs / errors: targeted backend `eslint` + `prettier --check` on touched files (pass)
  - Logs / errors: frontend `pnpm exec eslint` / `pnpm exec prettier` were not available in this environment (`'eslint' is not recognized`, `prettier not found`), so frontend verification here is limited to typecheck.
- Result:
  - Completed. Google OAuth login now honors the stored account role for existing users, YouTube disconnect is available, and the frontend integrations/campaign UI is aligned to the current backend endpoints.

## Task: Add SME stats, scouted creators, and campaign endpoints

- Date: 2026-05-21
- Request: Add backend support for `GET /users/sme/stats`, `GET /sme/creators/scouted`, campaign creation for SMEs, and adding creators to campaigns, with frontend-compatible response shapes and API/docs updates.
- Plan:
  - [x] Inspect existing users and creator-discovery patterns plus frontend response expectations.
  - [x] Add schema/repository support for SME scouting and campaigns, with migrations if possible.
  - [x] Implement controllers, services, and DTOs for SME stats, scouted creators, scout toggles, campaign creation, and campaign creator assignment.
  - [x] Update docs/tests/task memory and run targeted verification.
- Progress:
  - Confirmed the live frontend SME dashboard expects `totalReach`, `avgInfluenceScore`, `totalCreators`, and `discoveryCoverage` from `/users/sme/stats`.
  - Confirmed the frontend scouted list expects `/sme/creators/scouted` to return `{ creators: [...] }` with `userId`, `displayName`, `status`, `audienceSize`, and `influenceScore`.
  - Confirmed the backend currently has no scout or campaign persistence tables/endpoints, so this requires schema and module changes.
  - Added new Drizzle schema tables/enums for `sme_scouted_creators`, `sme_campaigns`, and `sme_campaign_creators`.
  - Implemented `GET /users/sme/stats`, `GET /sme/creators/scouted`, plus shortlist toggle routes used by the frontend: `POST /sme/creators/:id/scout` and `DELETE /sme/creators/:id/scout`.
  - Added new `sme-campaigns` module with `POST /sme/campaigns` and `POST /sme/campaigns/:campaignId/creators`.
  - Generated Drizzle migration `src/database/drizzle/migrations/20260521181113_bumpy_mandarin.sql` and updated repo-facing + agent-facing docs.
- Verification:
  - Tests: `cmd /c pnpm exec jest --runInBand --runTestsByPath src/modules/users/services/users.service.spec.ts src/modules/creator-discovery/creator-discovery.service.spec.ts src/modules/sme-campaigns/services/sme-campaigns.service.spec.ts` (pass)
  - Logs / errors: `cmd /c pnpm run typecheck` (pass)
  - Logs / errors: `cmd /c pnpm exec eslint --no-warn-ignored ...` on touched backend source files (pass)
  - Logs / errors: `cmd /c pnpm exec prettier --check ...` on touched docs/source/spec files (pass)
- Result:
  - Completed. SME dashboard stats, scouted creators, shortlist actions, and initial SME campaign endpoints are implemented with documented DTO shapes and a generated schema migration.

## Task: Support comma-separated CORS + OAuth redirect URIs

- Date: 2026-05-20
- Request: Parse comma-separated env values for CORS origins and frontend OAuth redirect URIs.
- Plan:
  - [ ] Update CORS origin parsing to accept comma-separated origins.
  - [ ] Add redirect selection helper for comma-separated frontend OAuth redirect URIs.
  - [ ] Update docs/findings and note verification steps.
- Progress:
  - Added comma-separated parsing for CORS origins and frontend OAuth redirects.
  - OAuth callbacks now select a redirect URL matching the request origin when possible.
- Verification:
  - Tests: not run (not requested)
  - Logs / errors: not run (not requested)
- Result:
  - Added comma-separated parsing for CORS origins and frontend OAuth redirect URIs with origin-based selection fallback.

## Task: Remove auth tokens from JSON responses

- Date: 2026-05-16
- Request: Inspect auth and OAuth endpoints now that cookies are returned, and stop including access/refresh tokens in login/signup/etc. JSON responses.
- Plan:
  - [x] Audit first-party auth token issuing endpoints and OAuth callback responses.
  - [x] Keep token pairs internal for cookie setting, but return public auth responses without token fields.
  - [x] Update refresh cookie fallback/docs/tests and verify focused auth behavior.
- Progress:
  - Confirmed `/auth/signup`, `/auth/login`, `/auth/admin/signup`, `/auth/admin/login`, `/auth/refresh`, and Google OAuth login callbacks still used `AuthResponseDto` with `accessToken`/`refreshToken` in JSON.
  - Confirmed stored Google OAuth refresh endpoint already hides the provider access token and only returns `tokenExpiresAt`.
  - Removed `accessToken` and `refreshToken` from the public `AuthResponseDto`; token-bearing results now use the internal `AuthTokenResponseDto` type.
  - Added `toPublicAuthResponse` and applied it to signup, login, admin signup/login, refresh, and Google OAuth login callbacks.
  - Changed `/auth/refresh` to read `ciap_refresh` from cookies when the body token is absent, while retaining JSON body fallback for compatibility.
  - Updated API docs and load test checks to assert cookies instead of token body fields.
- Verification:
  - Tests: `cmd /c pnpm exec jest --runInBand --runTestsByPath src/modules/auth/utils/auth-cookie.util.spec.ts src/modules/auth/services/auth.service.spec.ts src/modules/auth/services/auth-tokens.service.spec.ts src/modules/auth/services/auth-google-oauth.service.spec.ts src/modules/auth/socials/services/socials.service.spec.ts src/modules/users/services/users.service.spec.ts` (pass)
  - Logs / errors: `cmd /c pnpm exec eslint src/modules/auth src/modules/users` (pass)
  - Logs / errors: `cmd /c pnpm exec prettier --check ...` for touched auth/docs/load files (pass)
  - Logs / errors: `cmd /c pnpm exec tsc --noEmit --pretty false` still fails only on the pre-existing YouTube ingestion statistic type mismatch (`number` normalized stats passed to string-based Google response types).
- Result:
  - Completed. Auth and OAuth login/refresh endpoints now set token cookies and return tokenless JSON responses.

## Task: Organize auth and users module files

- Date: 2026-05-16
- Request: Move scattered module files into ordered folders so services, repositories, utilities, and controllers live in matching folders, while module files remain at module root; resolve imports.
- Plan:
  - [x] Inspect current auth/users module file placement and import paths.
  - [x] Move auth/users files into `controllers`, `services`, `repositories`, and `utils` folders, keeping `*.module.ts` at module root.
  - [x] Update imports, docs for module shape, and run focused verification.
- Progress:
  - Confirmed auth and users root folders mix controllers, services, repositories, utilities, and specs beside module files.
  - Moved `auth`, `auth/socials`, and `users` files into layer folders; kept `auth.module.ts` and `users.module.ts` at module roots.
  - Updated imports across auth, users, socials, and YouTube ingestion references to the moved `SocialsService`.
  - Updated project structure docs and findings to preserve the new placement rule.
- Verification:
  - Tests: `cmd /c pnpm exec jest --runInBand --runTestsByPath src/modules/auth/utils/auth-cookie.util.spec.ts src/modules/auth/services/auth.service.spec.ts src/modules/auth/services/auth-tokens.service.spec.ts src/modules/auth/services/auth-google-oauth.service.spec.ts src/modules/auth/socials/services/socials.service.spec.ts src/modules/users/services/users.service.spec.ts` (pass)
  - Logs / errors: `cmd /c pnpm exec eslint src/modules/auth/auth.module.ts src/modules/auth/controllers/auth.controller.ts src/modules/auth/services/auth.service.ts src/modules/auth/services/auth-tokens.service.ts src/modules/auth/services/auth-google-oauth.service.ts src/modules/auth/socials/controllers/socials.controller.ts src/modules/auth/socials/services/socials.service.ts src/modules/auth/utils/auth-cookie.util.ts src/modules/users/users.module.ts src/modules/users/controllers/users.controller.ts src/modules/users/services/users.service.ts src/modules/users/services/users-cache.service.ts src/modules/users/repositories/users.repository.ts src/modules/ingestion/youtube/youtube.service.ts src/modules/ingestion/youtube/services/youtube.service.ts` (pass)
  - Logs / errors: `cmd /c pnpm exec prettier --check ...` for moved source/docs (pass)
  - Logs / errors: `cmd /c pnpm exec tsc --noEmit --pretty false` still fails only on the pre-existing YouTube ingestion statistic type mismatch (`number` normalized stats passed to string-based Google response types).
- Result:
  - Completed. Auth, auth/socials, and users now use ordered module-local layer folders with imports resolved.

## Task: Apply auth token cookies to local auth flows

- Date: 2026-05-16
- Request: Reuse the OAuth httpOnly access/refresh cookie behavior for normal user/admin signup and login, correct the OAuth implementation if needed, and verify whether password updates cache sessions, passwords, or responses while Redis is intentionally off.
- Plan:
  - [x] Inspect OAuth callback cookie handling, local auth endpoints, token/session persistence, and password update cache usage.
  - [x] Centralize auth cookie setting and apply it to user/admin signup and login responses.
  - [x] Update docs/tests for the endpoint contract and record verification.
- Progress:
  - Confirmed OAuth callback routes duplicate `ciap_access`/`ciap_refresh` cookie setting and one path allows disabling `httpOnly` through `FRONTEND_OAUTH_USE_HTTP_ONLY`.
  - Confirmed local `/auth/signup`, `/auth/login`, `/auth/admin/signup`, and `/auth/admin/login` return token bodies but do not set auth cookies yet.
  - Confirmed `PATCH /auth/me/password` only clears the cached `/users/me` response via `UsersCacheService.deleteMe`; it does not cache sessions, passwords, or auth responses.
  - Added `setAuthTokenCookies` and reused it from local auth and OAuth callback controllers.
  - Updated API docs and added focused cookie coverage.
- Verification:
  - Tests: `cmd /c pnpm exec jest --runInBand --runTestsByPath src/modules/auth/utils/auth-cookie.util.spec.ts src/modules/auth/services/auth.service.spec.ts` (pass)
  - Logs / errors: `cmd /c pnpm exec eslint src/modules/auth/utils/auth-cookie.util.ts src/modules/auth/controllers/auth.controller.ts src/modules/auth/socials/controllers/socials.controller.ts` (pass)
  - Logs / errors: `cmd /c pnpm exec prettier --check src/modules/auth/utils/auth-cookie.util.ts src/modules/auth/utils/auth-cookie.util.spec.ts src/modules/auth/controllers/auth.controller.ts src/modules/auth/socials/controllers/socials.controller.ts src/modules/auth/services/auth.service.spec.ts docs/api.md tasks/todo.md` (pass)
  - Logs / errors: `cmd /c pnpm run typecheck` still fails in pre-existing YouTube ingestion service statistic type mismatches (`number` normalized stats passed to string-based Google response types).
- Result:
  - Completed. Local user/admin signup and login now set the same httpOnly token cookies as OAuth login while preserving the existing auth response body.

## Task: Add universal creator search module

- Date: 2026-05-08
- Request: Implement a universal search module with fuzzy search (pg_trgm/Levenshtein), limit 50, minimal query params; move existing search endpoints into the module.
- Plan:
  - [ ] Add search module (controller/service/repository/DTO) with a single query field and limit capped at 50.
  - [ ] Implement pg_trgm-based search with ranked results across name, niche, and bio; add indexes via migration.
  - [ ] Update existing creator search endpoint to route through the new module (or replace it), update docs, and add unit tests.
- Progress:
  - Added search module/controller/service/repository/DTOs and unit tests.
  - Added pg_trgm migration and wired creator search to the universal search service.
  - Updated docs and project structure notes for the new search module.
  - Added search cache responses and improved cache health fallback messaging.
- Verification:
  - Tests:
  - Logs / errors:
- Result:
  - Pending.

## Task: Expand YouTube queue payload for ML

- Date: 2026-05-08
- Request: Include all fetched comments, demographics details, and other relevant data in the YouTube queue payload; issue job IDs and log user/job ties.
- Plan:
  - [x] Extend the YouTube queue payload type to carry full comments and demographics details plus sync/summary metadata.
  - [x] Update ingestion enqueue logic to pass full comments, demographics, and counts into the queue payload.
  - [ ] Verify logs and job payload shape where the ML consumer reads the data.
- Progress:
  - Expanded the BullMQ job payload shape to include full comment sets, demographics details, and sync/summary metadata.
  - Updated enqueue logic to pass full comments, demographics, and accurate counts; logs include user/job.
  - Fixed typecheck issues by aligning cache module typing and updating legacy ingestion queue payload to the new shape.
- Verification:
  - Tests:
  - Logs / errors:
- Result:
  - Pending.

## Task: Fix duplicate YouTube comment persistence

- Date: 2026-05-08
- Request: Stop YouTube ingestion from repeating the same comments, keep only the first few unique comments when there are few available, and debug the current `youtube_video_comments` insert failure.
- Plan:
  - [x] Trace the comment fetch/sample/persist flow to confirm why the same comment ID appears multiple times in one batch.
  - [x] Patch comment handling so sample comments and persisted comments are deduplicated by `commentId`.
  - [x] Add focused tests, update task/docs memory, and verify the touched comment paths.
- Progress:
  - Confirmed the same top-level comment can appear in both the `relevance` and `time` commentThreads queries for a video.
  - Confirmed the current code concatenates `topComments` and `latestComments` directly for both sample display and persistence, which duplicates `youtube_comment_id` values in a single insert.
  - Deduplicated merged comment lists in the socials fetch layer before building `sampleComments`, preserving first-seen order so small comment sets just show the first unique comments returned.
  - Added a second defensive dedupe in ingestion persistence before `upsertVideoComments`, so duplicate `youtube_comment_id` values cannot be sent in the same insert batch even if upstream callers regress.
  - Added focused tests covering duplicate top/latest comment IDs in both the response sample path and the persistence path.
- Verification:
  - Tests: `cmd /c pnpm exec jest --config test/jest-e2e.json --runInBand --runTestsByPath src/modules/auth/socials/socials.service.spec.ts src/modules/ingestion/youtube/youtube.service.spec.ts` (pass)
  - Logs / errors: `cmd /c pnpm exec eslint src/modules/auth/socials/socials.service.ts src/modules/ingestion/youtube/services/youtube.service.ts` (pass)
  - Logs / errors: `cmd /c pnpm exec prettier --check src/modules/auth/socials/socials.service.spec.ts src/modules/ingestion/youtube/youtube.service.spec.ts tasks/todo.md` (pass)
- Result:
  - Fixed the duplicate comment insert failure by deduplicating repeated `commentId` values before sampling and before persistence.
  - Root cause was not the repository upsert itself; it was a single SQL insert batch containing the same `youtube_comment_id` twice, once from `topComments` and once from `latestComments`.

## Task: Fix YouTube demographics query failure

- Date: 2026-05-07
- Request: Debug the remaining `/ingestion/youtube/oauth2/callback` failure after the OAuth fixes, explain the `commentsDisabled` warnings, and fix the `400 badRequest` from the YouTube Analytics demographics query.
- Plan:
  - [x] Inspect the audience demographics query and verify the failing `country` report shape against the API.
  - [x] Patch country demographics fetching and make optional demographics failures degrade to warnings instead of failing the whole sync.
  - [x] Add focused tests, update task/docs memory, and verify the touched behavior.
- Progress:
  - Confirmed the `commentsDisabled` warnings are non-auth video-level comment fetch results and no longer the main failure.
  - Confirmed the remaining hard failure is `metrics=viewerPercentage&dimensions=country`, which returns `400 badRequest` from YouTube Analytics.
  - Switched country demographics to a valid `metrics=views&dimensions=country` analytics report, sorted by view count, and derived `viewerPercentage` locally from each country's share of the returned total.
  - Changed demographics fetching to tolerate recoverable optional-slice failures and return a warning instead of failing the whole OAuth callback/sync.
  - Added focused tests for country-share derivation and for downgrading recoverable demographics query failures.
- Verification:
  - Tests: `cmd /c pnpm exec jest --config test/jest-e2e.json --runInBand --runTestsByPath src/modules/auth/socials/socials.service.spec.ts` (pass)
  - Logs / errors: `cmd /c pnpm exec eslint src/modules/auth/socials/socials.service.ts` (pass)
  - Logs / errors: `cmd /c pnpm exec prettier --check src/modules/auth/socials/socials.service.spec.ts tasks/todo.md agent-docs/findings.md docs/api.md docs/database.md` (pass)
- Result:
  - Fixed the remaining callback failure by replacing the invalid country demographics query and treating optional demographics slices as non-fatal.
  - `commentsDisabled` is now just a warning-level per-video condition, and the `400 badRequest` was caused by an invalid YouTube Analytics metrics/dimensions combination rather than OAuth state or token problems.

## Task: Fix YouTube OAuth callback grant lookup + comment error handling

- Date: 2026-05-07
- Request: Debug the Google OAuth callback/state flow for YouTube connect after users hit `401 Invalid or malformed token` during `/ingestion/youtube/oauth2/callback`, make ingestion read only the `youtube-connect` grant, and explain the `commentsDisabled` errors.
- Plan:
  - [x] Trace the callback, state parsing, token persistence, and immediate sync path against the reported logs.
  - [x] Patch the YouTube connect grant lookup/storage so ingestion refreshes only a dedicated `youtube-connect` OAuth record.
  - [x] Fix comment-fetch error handling so `commentsDisabled` does not become `oauth2-link-required`.
  - [x] Add focused tests, update docs/memory, and record verification.
- Progress:
  - Confirmed the callback `state` is being parsed successfully and used to resolve the correct user/tenant.
  - Confirmed the failure happens after token exchange, during the immediate sync call to `commentThreads.list`.
  - Confirmed the first logged Google error was `ACCESS_TOKEN_SCOPE_INSUFFICIENT`, so the original failure was a scope mismatch in the post-connect fetch path rather than a malformed `state` token.
  - Added `youtube.force-ssl` to the YouTube connect scope set and reused the same scope list in reconnect metadata returned by `oauth2-link-required` responses.
  - Confirmed the later error payload already contained the full YouTube scope set, and the real Google reason had changed to `commentsDisabled` for a specific video.
  - Added `oauth_accounts.purpose` with migration backfill so existing token-bearing Google rows become `youtube-connect`, and changed Google token lookup/refresh to read only that purpose.
  - Changed comment-thread fetching to treat `commentsDisabled` as a per-video skip instead of an OAuth reconnect failure.
  - Added focused unit tests for YouTube OAuth scope preparation, `youtube-connect` grant persistence, `youtube-connect` grant lookup during ingestion, and disabled-comment handling.
  - Generated Drizzle migration `20260507100607_old_meltdown.sql` and patched its backfill so existing token-bearing Google rows are migrated to `youtube-connect` instead of `login`.
- Verification:
  - Tests: `cmd /c pnpm exec jest --config test/jest-e2e.json --runInBand --runTestsByPath src/modules/auth/auth.service.spec.ts src/modules/auth/auth-google-oauth.service.spec.ts src/modules/auth/socials/socials.service.spec.ts src/modules/ingestion/youtube/youtube.service.spec.ts` (pass)
  - Logs / errors: `cmd /c pnpm exec eslint src/modules/auth/auth.repository.ts src/modules/auth/auth.service.ts src/modules/auth/auth-google-oauth.service.ts src/modules/auth/socials/socials.service.ts src/database/drizzle/schema.ts` (pass)
  - Logs / errors: `cmd /c pnpm exec prettier --check docs/api.md docs/database.md agent-docs/findings.md tasks/todo.md` (pass)
  - Logs / errors: `cmd /c pnpm run typecheck` still fails in pre-existing unrelated files: `src/modules/cache/cache.module.ts` generic cache typing and `src/modules/ingestion/youtube/youtube.service.ts` `YoutubeMetricsJobPayload` mismatch from ongoing ingestion changes.
- Result:
  - Fixed the misleading callback failure path by aligning the YouTube connect scope set, separating stored Google login vs `youtube-connect` grants, and stopping `commentsDisabled` videos from failing the whole sync.
  - Root cause was not malformed OAuth `state`. The two concrete failures were: `ACCESS_TOKEN_SCOPE_INSUFFICIENT` before the scope fix, and later `commentsDisabled` being misclassified as an OAuth scope problem.

## Task: Expand YouTube ingestion data + queue

- Date: 2026-05-07
- Request: Pull YouTube comments and audience demographics, ensure access token refresh after expiry, cache fetched data in Redis with TTL, persist to DB, and consolidate BullMQ to one youtube queue carrying latest data + 10 video stats.
- Plan:
  - [x] Confirm required demographics fields, comment volume, cache TTL, and cache-first behavior; align response/queue payload expectations.
  - [x] Add schema + repository support for comments and demographics; normalize and persist alongside existing channel/video/analytics flow.
  - [x] Update ingestion/socials flow to refresh tokens reliably, use cache when valid, and cache new data.
  - [x] Consolidate BullMQ to single youtube queue/job payload and adjust worker/processor + tests.
  - [x] Update docs/tests for changed contracts.
- Progress:
  - Confirmed: TTL 2h, pull top 20 + latest 50 comments, demographics ageGroup/gender/country, no cache read for ingestion, and return only 5 comment samples.
  - Implemented YouTube comments + demographics fetch, persistence, and queue payload consolidation.
  - Updated ingestion response to include comment samples, counts, and demographics; disabled cache writes for ingestion.
  - Updated queue worker/processor names and Swagger examples; refreshed docs and tests.
- Verification:
  - Tests:
  - Logs / errors:
- Result:
  - Pending.

## Task: Finish creator onboarding + search query handling

- Date: 2026-04-25
- Request: Finish the creator onboarding endpoint and onboarded boolean flow, support multiple creator types, ignore empty `bioQuery` on creator search endpoints, and fix the current ESLint errors in creator discovery and queue service.
- Plan:
  - [x] Audit the partial onboarding implementation in `users` and existing creator-discovery search flow.
  - [x] Implement the missing users service/controller/repository wiring for creator onboarding and onboarded profile fields.
  - [x] Normalize empty `bioQuery` handling in creator search/discovery, fix lint errors, and update docs/tests.
  - [x] Run lint/typecheck/tests for touched areas and record the outcome.
- Progress:
  - Confirmed `user_profiles` already stores `creatorTypes` and `isOnboarded`, and `POST /users/me/onboard` is already scaffolded in `UsersController`.
  - Confirmed `UsersService` is missing the onboarding and platform-status methods referenced by the controller, so the feature is only partially wired.
  - Confirmed creator search already supports `bioQuery`, but the service/controller path does not normalize empty-string input before cache/repository calls.
  - Completed the creator onboarding service flow, cache invalidation, `/users/me` onboarded fields, and `GET /users/:id/platform-status` service wiring.
  - Normalized blank search text in `CreatorDiscoveryService` so empty `bioQuery` is ignored consistently before cache/repository use.
  - Updated unit tests for `users` and `creator-discovery`, and tightened DTO/service typing where lint and typecheck exposed gaps.
- Verification:
  - Tests: `cmd /c pnpm exec jest --config test/jest-e2e.json --runInBand --runTestsByPath src/modules/users/users.service.spec.ts src/modules/creator-discovery/creator-discovery.service.spec.ts` (pass)
  - Logs / errors: `cmd /c pnpm run lint-fix` (pass)
  - Logs / errors: `cmd /c pnpm run typecheck` (pass)
- Result:
  - Completed. Creator onboarding now persists multiple `creatorTypes`, sets `isOnboarded`, invalidates cached `/users/me`, and exposes onboarding state in the dashboard response.
  - Blank `bioQuery` values no longer narrow creator search results, and the reported ESLint failures in creator discovery and queue service are resolved.

## Task: Add /me and expand insights

- Date: 2026-04-25
- Request: Expand creator insights (content performance, growth, engagement, summaries, time series), add /me endpoint for creators and SMEs, add SME creator profile endpoint, and expose platform connected status.
- Plan:
  - [x] Audit existing insights/creator discovery modules and define DTOs + response shapes.
  - [x] Implement /me endpoint with role-based response and platform connected status.
  - [x] Add creator insights additions + SME creator profile endpoint with cached data and placeholders.
  - [x] Update docs/api.md and any related docs; add tests where logic changes.
- Progress:
  - Added creator performance insights endpoint and caching.
  - Added /users/me dashboard response with platform status.
  - Added SME creator profile endpoint with placeholders for demographics and sentiment.
  - Updated API docs with new routes.
  - Cached /users/me responses in Redis to reduce repeated lookups.
- Verification:
  - Tests:
  - Logs / errors:
- Result:
  - Implemented /me dashboard and expanded creator insights + SME creator profile responses with consistent caching.

## Task: Open creator search to all roles + optimize

- Date: 2026-04-25
- Request: Allow all roles to search creators, improve efficiency/caching, document Swagger, and update roadmap + agent comment guidance.
- Plan:
  - [x] Adjust creator search auth rules and response shape for usefulness.
  - [x] Tighten repository query efficiency and confirm index coverage.
  - [x] Update docs (Swagger/API docs, README roadmap, agent-docs comment guidance).
- Progress:
  - Updated creator search to allow any authenticated role and clarified Swagger.
  - Coalesced audience size to avoid nulls and added deterministic ordering for pagination.
  - Updated API docs, README roadmap, and agent comment guidance.
- Verification:
  - Tests:
  - Logs / errors:
- Result:
  - Creator search is open to all roles, uses stable ordering with cached results, and docs reflect the new behavior.

## Task: Add creator search endpoint + stateful scan

- Date: 2026-04-25
- Request: Implement a creator search endpoint using direct DB queries with an external search placeholder, then scan the repo for stateful services and Redis candidates.
- Plan:
  - [x] Add a creator search endpoint + service method wired to repository queries and placeholder external search hook.
  - [x] Update Swagger + docs/api.md for the new endpoint contract.
  - [x] Scan repo for stateful services and list Redis migration candidates.
- Progress:
  - Added search endpoint + service logic with external search placeholder and cache.
  - Added unit tests for search caching behavior.
  - Documented endpoint and prepared stateful services scan summary.
- Verification:
  - Tests:
  - Logs / errors:
- Result:
  - Added `GET /sme/creators/search` with MVP DB search and external search placeholder; updated API docs and tests.
  - Reviewed stateful services and Redis migration candidates.

## Task: Diagnose creator discovery + compare empty results

- Date: 2026-04-23
- Request: Investigate why creator discovery/compare returns empty results and identify logic flaws.
- Plan:
  - [x] Trace discovery + compare query flow (controller -> service -> repository) and identify filters.
  - [x] Validate schema expectations (profiles, influenceScore, content items) and compare with likely data states.
  - [x] Summarize root causes and propose fixes or experiments to confirm.
- Progress:
  - Located discovery/compare controller, service, repository, DTOs, and schema definitions.
- Verification:
  - Tests:
  - Logs / errors:
- Result:
  - Likely causes for empty results: influenceScore is nullable and filtered by strict min/max; platform filter requires content_items rows; search only checks displayName/bio; user_profiles inner join excludes creators without profiles; results are cached for 1 hour.

## Task: Stop Google login from overwriting YouTube OAuth grants

- Date: 2026-04-23
- Request: Confirm whether YouTube metrics was reusing the wrong Google token set, decide whether separate storage is needed for login vs YouTube tokens, and fix the bug safely.
- Plan:
  - [x] Trace Google login, YouTube connect, and YouTube metrics token resolution paths.
  - [x] Patch the shared-storage bug with the smallest safe change.
  - [x] Add focused tests and verify lint/typecheck status for the touched auth/socials code.
- Progress:
  - Confirmed the repo stores a single Google `oauth_accounts` row per linked account/provider and both login + YouTube connect were writing into that same slot.
  - Confirmed `/ingestion/youtube/metrics` reads that same stored Google row, so a later login could replace the YouTube-scoped grant with a basic login-scoped token and trigger Google `insufficientPermissions` on YouTube APIs.
  - Stopped the login authorization-code flow from persisting Google API access/refresh tokens; only the YouTube connect flow now stores Google tokens for API use.
  - Updated YouTube metrics to return reconnect guidance when the stored Google grant lacks YouTube scopes, instead of surfacing a raw 403 from Google.
- Verification:
  - Tests: `cmd /c pnpm exec jest --config test/jest-e2e.json --runInBand --runTestsByPath src/modules/auth/auth.service.spec.ts src/modules/auth/socials/socials.service.spec.ts src/modules/ingestion/youtube/youtube.service.spec.ts` (pass)
  - Logs / errors: `cmd /c pnpm exec eslint src/modules/auth/auth.service.ts src/modules/auth/auth-google-oauth.service.ts src/modules/auth/socials/socials.service.ts` (pass)
  - Logs / errors: `cmd /c pnpm run typecheck` (pass)
- Result:
  - Completed. The YouTube metrics bug was caused by shared Google token storage, and the fix keeps login-scoped Google tokens out of persistent integration storage.
  - Separate columns are not the best next step here; the smaller safe design is to persist only the YouTube/API grant. If the product later needs multiple Google grants concurrently, model them as separate records by purpose, not as parallel token columns on one row.

## Task: Fix runtime missing safer-buffer during POST body parsing

- Date: 2026-04-23
- Request: Fix the reported `/auth/refresh` production failure and check whether `package.json` is missing a required dependency.
- Plan:
  - [x] Trace the stack to confirm whether the failure is in refresh logic or lower-level request parsing.
  - [x] Check `package.json`/lockfile for the missing module and add the smallest safe runtime fix.
  - [x] Verify the dependency resolves locally and summarize the actual root cause.
- Progress:
  - Confirmed the stack fails inside `body-parser -> raw-body -> iconv-lite`, before auth refresh logic executes.
  - Confirmed `safer-buffer` existed only as a transitive dependency of `iconv-lite`, not as a direct runtime dependency in `package.json`.
  - Added `safer-buffer@2.1.2` as an explicit dependency using offline pnpm install with the existing store path.
- Verification:
  - Tests: `node -e "console.log(require.resolve('safer-buffer'))"` (pass)
  - Logs / errors: `pnpm add safer-buffer@^2.1.2 --offline --store-dir C:\\Users\\USER\\AppData\\Local\\pnpm\\store\\v10` updated `package.json` and `pnpm-lock.yaml`
- Result:
  - Completed. The immediate runtime failure was a missing module in request body parsing, not a refresh-token implementation bug.
  - `package.json` now declares `safer-buffer` explicitly so production images do not rely on that transitive dependency being laid out correctly.

## Task: Add rediss support to BullMQ queue config

- Date: 2026-04-22
- Request: Patch the queue config to properly support `rediss://` Redis endpoints and confirm whether the app supported that before.
- Plan:
  - [x] Extend `QueueConfigService` to parse `rediss://`, ACL usernames, and `/db` indexes.
  - [x] Add a focused unit test for queue Redis URL parsing.
  - [x] Update env/docs examples and verify with tests + typecheck.
- Progress:
  - Updated `QueueConfigService.parseRedisUrl()` to validate protocol, propagate ACL username/password, parse the DB index from the URL path, and enable TLS when `REDIS_URL` uses `rediss:`.
  - Added `queue-config.service.spec.ts` covering `redis://`, `rediss://`, default DB handling, and unsupported protocol rejection.
  - Updated `.env.example`, `README.md`, and `docs/environment.md` to document `rediss://` support for BullMQ.
- Verification:
  - Tests: `cmd /c pnpm exec jest --config test/jest-e2e.json --runInBand --runTestsByPath src/modules/queue/queue-config.service.spec.ts` (pass)
  - Tests: `cmd /c pnpm run typecheck` (pass)
  - Logs / errors: `cmd /c pnpm exec eslint src/modules/queue/queue-config.service.ts` (pass)
  - Logs / errors: linting the new spec with `--no-ignore` still fails because the repo ESLint project service excludes `*.spec.ts` from `tsconfig.json`; Jest verification was used instead.
- Result:
  - Completed. BullMQ queue connections now support `rediss://` endpoints instead of assuming plain `redis://` with DB 0 only.
  - Confirmed the previous queue implementation did not truly support `rediss://`; it ignored TLS, ACL usernames, and non-zero DB indexes.

## Task: Diagnose BullMQ ECONNRESET on youtube-metrics queue

- Date: 2026-04-22
- Request: Consume `AGENTS.md` and `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, then identify the repeated `QueueService` `ECONNRESET` error for `youtube-metrics`.
- Plan:
  - [x] Read repo instruction entry points and relevant agent docs.
  - [x] Trace the enqueue path for `youtube-metrics` and inspect BullMQ/Redis configuration.
  - [x] Summarize the concrete failure point and record any durable repo finding.
- Progress:
  - Confirmed the error is emitted by BullMQ/ioredis from `QueueService`, not by the YouTube processor or logger.
  - Traced the failing path: `YoutubeIngestionService.enqueueIngestionJobs()` calls `QueueService.addYoutubeMetricsJob()`, which calls `queue.count()` and `queue.add()` against Redis.
  - Confirmed the in-process worker is disabled in `YoutubeIngestionModule`; this API instance is acting as a producer, while a separate ML service is expected to consume the queue.
  - Confirmed `QueueConfigService.parseRedisUrl()` only maps `host`, `port`, `password`, and hard-coded `db: 0`, so BullMQ only supports a plain `redis://` style connection in the current code.
- Verification:
  - Tests: not run (debugging task)
  - Logs / errors: provided stack trace shows `ioredis` socket-level `write ECONNRESET` and `read ECONNRESET` errors while `QueueService` is connected to `youtube-metrics`
- Result:
  - Identified as a Redis/BullMQ connectivity reset, not an application logic failure in the YouTube ingestion flow.
  - Most likely causes are deployment Redis availability/network interruption, or a managed Redis endpoint requiring settings this parser does not pass through, especially TLS for `rediss://`.

## Task: Fix winston logger pre-commit lint failure

- Date: 2026-04-22
- Request: Fix the Husky pre-commit ESLint failure in `src/common/logging/winston.logger.ts`.
- Plan:
  - [x] Inspect the logger file and staged diff to confirm the exact lint trigger.
  - [x] Replace unsafe string coercion with an explicit timestamp type guard.
  - [x] Verify ESLint passes for the logger file.
- Progress:
  - Confirmed the staged logger formatter used `String(timestamp ?? '')`, which triggers `@typescript-eslint/no-base-to-string` because `timestamp` can be typed as an object in the formatter callback.
  - Narrowed `timestamp` to `string | Date` before formatting and fall back to an empty string for other cases.
- Verification:
  - Tests: `cmd /c pnpm exec eslint src/common/logging/winston.logger.ts` (pass)
  - Logs / errors: initial verification exposed Prettier CRLF normalization errors after the patch; `cmd /c pnpm exec eslint --fix src/common/logging/winston.logger.ts` resolved them.
- Result:
  - Completed. The logger formatter now avoids unsafe object stringification for `timestamp`, and the staged file passes ESLint for the Husky pre-commit path.

## Task: Fix socials controller pre-commit lint failure

- Date: 2026-04-22
- Request: Consume `AGENTS.md` and Copilot instructions, then fix the Husky pre-commit ESLint failure in `src/modules/auth/socials/socials.controller.ts`.
- Plan:
  - [x] Read repo instruction entry points and inspect the failing controller.
  - [x] Compare staged vs working-tree versions to confirm the exact lint trigger.
  - [x] Reconcile the controller so the staged file matches the fixed implementation.
  - [x] Verify ESLint passes for the controller path.
- Progress:
  - Confirmed `src/modules/auth/socials/socials.controller.ts` was `MM`: the staged copy still had `async deprecatedGoogleIdTokenLogin()`, while the working tree had already removed `async`.
  - Confirmed the hook failure was caused by linting the staged version, not the current working-tree file.
- Verification:
  - Tests: `cmd /c pnpm exec eslint src/modules/auth/socials/socials.controller.ts` (pass)
  - Logs / errors: Husky failure mapped to staged file state; no controller ESLint errors remain after reconciling index/work tree.
- Result:
  - Fixed the pre-commit lint issue by aligning the staged controller with the non-`async` implementation already present in the working tree.

  - [ ] Validate by retrying YouTube connect flow.
- Progress:
  - Added `include_granted_scopes` for YouTube connect OAuth.
  - Enforced access + refresh token presence on YouTube connect.
  - Added Google API failure logs with endpoint + reason.
  - Added analytics warning metadata for 403 responses.
  - Added typed 404 when account has no YouTube channel.
  - Updated ingestion endpoints to return 200 with warning on no-channel.
- Verification:

- Verification:
  - Tests: not run (requested fixes only)
  - Logs / errors: not checked
- Result:
  - Completed initial fixes for the reported failures; awaiting scope for additional test creation.

## Task: Wire commit hooks and lint-staged

- Date: 2026-04-16
- Request: Wire Commitlint + lint-staged via Husky and correct scripts/hooks.
- Plan:

  - Logs / errors: `get_errors` shows existing lint/style warnings in `auth.service.ts` not addressed
- Result:
  - Completed. New OAuth split, creator insights, SME discovery, schema updates, and YouTube connect flow are in place.

## Task: Use stored Google OAuth tokens for YouTube endpoints

- Date: 2026-04-10
- Request: Make YouTube metrics endpoints use stored Google OAuth tokens (no `x-google-access-token` header) so app JWT is sufficient once OAuth is linked.
- Plan:
  - [x] Remove `x-google-access-token` header usage in controllers and docs.
  - [x] Update SocialsService token resolution to rely on stored tokens only.
  - [x] Record results and verification status.

  - [x] Update seed logic to insert missing tenants, map tenant IDs by slug, and build user seed data from that map.
  - [x] Document results and verification.
- Progress:
  - Seed failure traced to hard-coded tenant IDs in `SEED_USERS` and unique slug collisions when re-seeding.
  - Added slug-based tenant mapping and missing-tenant insert to make seeds idempotent.
- Verification:
  - Tests: not run (seed logic change only)
  - Logs / errors: n/a
- Result:
  - Completed. Seed now maps tenant IDs by slug and skips existing tenants, avoiding FK and unique constraint failures.

## Task: Replace Neon dev DB URL with generic Postgres

- Date: 2026-04-10

## Task: RBAC hardening, socials submodule, and Google token lifecycle

- Date: 2026-04-09
- Request: Enforce stricter admin/sme RBAC and tenant boundaries, separate admin auth endpoints, extract Google/social OAuth concerns into a socials submodule, store and refresh Google OAuth tokens for YouTube API usage, prep BullMQ contracts (without queue implementation), remove duplicate health/docs placeholders, optimize user counting, and enforce no-explicit-any.
- Plan:
  - [x] Split role onboarding rules (public vs admin) and add dedicated admin auth endpoints.
  - [x] Extract Google/social auth into `auth/socials` submodule with token storage + refresh logic.
  - [x] Add protected socials endpoints for YouTube channel/video/analytics pull and job-payload prep (no persistence).
  - [x] Tighten users RBAC route split (`/users` tenant list vs admin-only list), strengthen tenant policy checks, and optimize repository count query.
  - [x] Remove duplicate health endpoint overlap and hardcoded Swagger placeholder values.
  - [x] Enforce `no-explicit-any` and update affected typing patterns.
  - [x] Update docs/findings and verify with typecheck/lint.
- Progress:
  - Repo scan completed; identified mixed admin/sme list endpoint, permissive onboarding role DTO usage, and non-isolated social auth/token lifecycle in `AuthService`.
  - Added admin-specific auth endpoints and role-safe onboarding DTO constraints (`user|sme|creator` only for public/social onboarding).
  - Created `auth/socials` submodule with Google OAuth routes, stored token refresh route, YouTube metrics pull route, and BullMQ payload contract route.
  - Persisted Google OAuth access/refresh/expiry tokens in `oauth_accounts` and added refresh exchange logic.
  - Split users list endpoint responsibilities: `/users` (tenant list for `sme`) and `/users/admin/all` (global list for `admin`), and optimized repository count query with DB-side aggregation.
  - Removed duplicate health behavior from app service/controller path, keeping health behavior in dedicated health module routes.
  - Updated Swagger configuration/tags and endpoint examples for improved API docs UI clarity.
  - Enforced `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` and replaced explicit-any typing patterns with safer alternatives in shared exception/filter/type files.
- Verification:
  - Tests: `cmd /c pnpm run typecheck` (pass)
  - Logs / errors: `cmd /c pnpm run lint` still reports existing repository-wide baseline issues (not introduced by this task), including linting generated `dist/` files and project-service scope mismatch.
- Result:
  - Completed. Auth/social responsibilities are separated, Swagger API docs/examples are updated, duplicate/overlapping API concerns were cleaned, and RBAC/tenant boundaries were tightened for users and social token usage.

## Task: Handle Google OAuth callback invalid_grant without 500

- Date: 2026-04-09
- Request: Preload agent instructions and handle OAuth callback `invalid_grant` error currently returning HTTP 500.
- Plan:
  - [x] Inspect current Google OAuth callback path and reproduce likely failure mode from logs.
  - [x] Translate Google token exchange errors into typed auth/validation exceptions.
  - [x] Validate callback query input and update route docs/decorators for expected failures.
  - [x] Verify with typecheck and close task log with result.
- Progress:
  - Reviewed auth controller/service flow and confirmed `loginWithGoogleAuthorizationCode` lets Google `invalid_grant` bubble to global 500 handler.
  - Added explicit `code` query validation in callback routes and in service-level OAuth exchange path.
  - Added error translation for Google token exchange so `invalid_grant` becomes `InvalidTokenException` (401) instead of unhandled 500.
  - Updated Swagger callback decorators and `docs/api.md` callback error cases.
- Verification:
  - Tests: `cmd /c pnpm run typecheck` (pass)
  - Logs / errors: no TypeScript errors after callback error-handling patch.
- Result:
  - Completed. OAuth callback bad/expired/reused Google auth code paths now return typed client errors rather than internal server error.

## Task: YouTube metrics expansion, normalization, and BullMQ queue infrastructure

- Date: 2026-04-11
- Request: Expand YouTube metrics API to fetch full analytics and engagement data, normalize and persist to database with Redis caching, implement BullMQ queue system for ML job processing with retries/DLQ/backoff, and design for content intelligence + growth tracking.
- Plan:
  - [x] Expand YouTube API calls to return all engagement metrics (likes, comments, duration) + full analytics columns (views, watch time, subscriber velocity).
  - [x] Create normalized database schema: `youtube_channels`, `youtube_videos`, `youtube_daily_analytics` with relations and indexes.
  - [x] Build normalization service to transform raw YouTube API response to typed, validated records (string→int conversion, ISO8601 duration parsing, BigInt for view counts).
  - [x] Create Redis cache service with TTL-based storage and invalidation for normalized data.
  - [x] Create BullMQ queue module with env-driven config: retries (3 with exponential backoff), DLQ for failed jobs, backoff strategy when queue depth > 100.
  - [ ] Create job processor for ML scoring: accepts normalized data, runs ML pipeline, logs results.
  - [ ] Update ingestion controller/service to orchestrate: call API → normalize → cache → persist → queue job.
  - [ ] End-to-end test: verify full pipeline from API fetch to ML job enqueue.
- Progress:
  - ✅ Expanded YouTube API types in `socials.service.ts` to capture full response structure with engagement metrics.

  - ✅ Created `redis-cache.service.ts`: Generic Redis caching with TTL, pattern deletion, health checks, graceful shutdown (reusable by all modules).
  - ✅ Created `youtube-cache.service.ts`: YouTube-specific cache with domain-aware key patterns and invalidation logic.
  - ✅ Created `cache.module.ts`: NestJS module provider exporting both `RedisCacheService` and `YoutubeCacheService` for dependency injection.
  - ✅ Wired `CacheModule` into `YouTubeIngestionModule` for local YouTube cache injection.
  - ✅ Wired `CacheModule` and `QueueModule` globally in `AppModule` for availability across all modules.
  - ✅ Created BullMQ queue module: `queue-config.service.ts` (env-driven config), `queue.service.ts` (job enqueue/DLQ/backpressure), `queue.module.ts` (NestJS integration).
  - ✅ Created job processor infrastructure:
    - Added `youtube_ml_scores` table to schema with relations and indexes for storing ML scoring results.
    - Created `youtube-metrics.processor.ts`: Job handler with placeholder ML scoring (engagement + growth + recommendation score).
    - Created `youtube-metrics.repository.ts`: Persistence layer for ML score upserts.
    - Created `youtube.repository.ts`: Data access for channel/video/analytics queries (used by processor).
    - Created `youtube-queue.worker.ts`: BullMQ worker lifecycle management with graceful shutdown.
    - Updated `youtube.module.ts` to register processor, repositories, worker, and export for controller use.
  - ⏳ Next: Update ingestion controller to orchestrate full pipeline (fetch → normalize → cache → persist → queue).
  - ⏳ Next: E2E test and verification.
- Verification:
  - Tests: Schema migration pending (`pnpm run db:generate && db:migrate`); normalization service unit tests planned.
  - Logs / errors: TypeScript strict mode pass assumed (types added, no-explicit-any avoided).
- Result:
  - In Progress. Schema and normalization layer complete. Next: caching and queue infrastructure.
- Custom Agent Instructions:

### Findings Report

#### Critical Bugs Fixed

**1. Broken upsert patterns across all repositories** (severity: critical, data corruption)

All four repositories that use `onConflictDoUpdate` with multiple rows were using
`videos[0]?.field` (the first item's values) as the conflict update target instead of
the SQL `EXCLUDED` pseudo-table. This caused every conflicting row in a batch to be
updated with the **first item's values**, silently overwriting all other rows with wrong data.

Files fixed:

- `youtube.repository.ts` — `upsertVideos()` and `upsertDailyAnalytics()`
- `content.repository.ts` — `upsertContentItems()`
- `youtube-metrics.repository.ts` — `upsertMlScores()`

Fix: Use `sql\`excluded.<column_name>\``for each field in the`set` clause.

**2. Missing unique constraints for conflict targets** (severity: critical, runtime crash)

Two tables had `onConflictDoUpdate` targets that referenced columns without unique indexes:

- `youtubeDailyAnalytics`: upsert used `(channelId, analyticsDate)` but only had
  separate single-column indexes. Without a composite unique index Postgres throws an error.
- `youtubeMlScores`: upsert used `videoId` but only had a regular (non-unique) index.

Fix: Added `uniqueIndex('youtube_daily_analytics_channel_date_uq')` on `(channelId, analyticsDate)`
and replaced the regular `videoId` index with `uniqueIndex('youtube_ml_scores_video_id_uq')`.
A Drizzle migration was generated.

**3. OAuth2Client singleton race condition** (severity: critical, security/data)

`refreshGoogleOauthTokensForUser()` called `googleClient.setCredentials({ refresh_token })` on a
shared singleton `this.oauthClient`. Under concurrent requests, two callers could overwrite each
other's credentials, causing one user's refresh token to be exchanged with another user's Google
client state, returning an invalid access token.

Fix: Create a fresh `OAuth2Client` instance per refresh call instead of mutating the singleton.

**4. Channel approval state lost on cache flush** (severity: high, business logic)

`approveChannel()` and `approvePermissions()` only wrote approval state to Redis (cache).
There was no `isApproved` field in the `youtube_channels` table. After a Redis flush or TTL
expiry the approval status was permanently lost.

Fix: Added `isApproved boolean DEFAULT false` and `approvedAt timestamptz` columns to
`youtube_channels`. The service now calls `repository.approveChannel()` to persist state to DB,
then also caches it. Included in the generated migration.

#### Security Fixes

**5. Timing attack in admin signup key comparison** (severity: medium, security)

`dto.adminSignupKey !== expectedAdminSignupKey` uses a direct string comparison, which leaks
timing information about how many characters match. An attacker making many requests can determine
the expected key character-by-character.

Fix: Use Node's `timingSafeEqual(Buffer.from(provided), Buffer.from(expected))` for constant-time
comparison. Length mismatch is checked first (short-circuit is acceptable here since key length
is not a secret in this context).

**6. Ownership check leaking resource existence via wrong exception** (severity: medium, security)

When a user requested approval for a YouTube channel they do not own, the service threw
`NotFoundException('channel does not belong to authenticated user')`. This tells the caller the
channel _exists_, leaking resource existence for arbitrary channel IDs.

Fix: Changed to `ForbiddenException` in both `approveChannel()` and `approvePermissions()` in
`services/youtube.service.ts`, and in the legacy `youtube.service.ts`.

#### Code Quality Fixes

**7. Missing `@Injectable()` on YoutubeNormalizationService** (severity: medium, DI)

`YoutubeNormalizationService` was declared as a regular class without `@Injectable()`. NestJS DI
still works when there are no constructor dependencies, but the decorator is required by NestJS
convention and needed if constructor deps are ever added.

Fix: Added `@Injectable()` decorator.

### Remaining Known Issues (pre-existing, out of scope)

These were identified during analysis but are pre-existing and not introduced by this PR:

- `queue.service.ts` line 59: `String(jobId)` where `jobId` may be an object in newer BullMQ
  versions. Produces `[object Object]` in logs.
- `socials.controller.ts` line 38: `deprecatedGoogleIdTokenLogin` declared `async` with no `await`.
- `redis-cache.service.ts` line 113: `deletePattern` declared `async` with no `await`.
- `youtube-cache.service.ts` line 115: `getChannelVideos` declared `async` with no `await`.
- `youtube-queue.worker.ts` line 40: unsafe BullMQ job type argument mismatch.
- `buildContentMetricsFromAnalytics` sets `contentItemId: null` for all metrics, losing the
  video-to-metric association. Should resolve the video's `contentItem.id` before writing.
- `getAnalyticsForDateRange` in `youtube.repository.ts` ignores the "date range" implied by its
  name — it returns all analytics for a channel with no date filter. Function signature
  should add `startDate`/`endDate` params.
- ML scoring `performanceRank` is assigned in fetch order, not sorted by recommendation score.
  The processor should sort `scores` by `recommendationScore DESC` before assigning ranks.
- Google Analytics 403 responses are all thrown as `InsufficientPermissionsException`. YouTube
  Analytics also returns 403 for quota exceeded and for channels with insufficient data (new
  channels). These should be distinguished by checking `error.errors[0].reason`.

- Verification:
  - Tests: `pnpm run typecheck` passes, `pnpm run lint` passes for changed files
  - Logs / errors: 6 pre-existing lint errors remain in unmodified files
- Result:
  - 4 critical bugs fixed (broken upserts, OAuth race condition, missing DB constraints, lost approval state)
  - 2 security issues fixed (timing attack, wrong exception type)
  - 1 DI decorator fixed
  - Migration generated for schema changes
